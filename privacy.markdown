## Overview

AI Code Blog ("we," "our," or "this site") respects your privacy. This policy explains what data we collect, how we use it, and your rights regarding that data.

## Data We Collect

### Analytics Data (Google Analytics 4)

When you consent to cookies, we use Google Analytics 4 (GA4) to collect anonymous usage data, including:

- Pages visited and time spent on each page
- Referral source (how you arrived at the site)
- General geographic region (country/city level, not precise location)
- Device type, browser, and operating system
- Interactions such as clicks and scroll depth

This data is aggregated and anonymous — we cannot identify individual visitors.

### Data We Do NOT Collect

- Personal information (name, email, address) — unless you voluntarily provide it via the contact page
- Financial information
- Precise location data
- Data from users who decline cookies

## How We Collect Data

### Cookies

When you accept cookies, Google Analytics sets the following cookies:

| Cookie | Purpose | Duration |
|--------|---------|----------|
| `_ga` | Distinguishes unique visitors | 2 years |
| `_ga_<container-id>` | Maintains session state | 2 years |

These cookies are only set after you explicitly consent via the cookie banner. If you decline, no cookies are set.

### Google Consent Mode v2

This site uses Google Consent Mode v2. If you decline cookies:

- No analytics cookies are set
- GA4 sends cookieless pings with limited, aggregated data
- No individual user data is collected or stored

We do not sell, share, or rent your data to third parties.
