My name is Matthew Brandenburg. I am a software developer with 10 years of experience. I have been following AI-assisted coding since 2023 but didn't get into it seriously until 2025.

This site is a place for me to share my experience and document my processes.

Check out my [uses page](/uses/) to see what tools and setup I work with.
