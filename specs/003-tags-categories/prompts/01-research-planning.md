# Prompt: Research & Planning

Read the feature spec at `specs/NNN-feature-name/spec.md` and all supporting documents in that directory.

## Objectives

1. Research the requirements and identify the best approach
2. Document findings in `notes.md` under the Research & Planning section
3. Identify open questions and flag them for discussion
4. Record any decisions made in `decisions.md`
5. Break down the implementation into concrete tasks in `tasks.md` (Phase 2 section)
6. Update `checklist.md` as items are completed

## Constraints

- Do NOT write any implementation code during this phase
- Focus on understanding, research, and planning only
- If there are multiple valid approaches, document them in `decisions.md` and recommend one
- Ask for clarification on anything ambiguous in the spec

## Deliverables

- [ ] Completed Research & Planning section in `notes.md`
- [ ] Open questions resolved or flagged
- [ ] Decisions documented in `decisions.md`
- [ ] Tasks broken down in `tasks.md`
- [ ] Research & Planning items checked off in `checklist.md`
- [ ] Phase History updated in `spec.md`

## When Done

Summarize your findings and present the task breakdown for review before moving to Implementation.
