# Prompt: Implementation

Read the feature spec at `specs/009-search/spec.md` and all supporting documents in that directory — especially `tasks.md` and `decisions.md`.

## Objectives

1. Create a feature branch (e.g., `feature/009-search`)
2. Implement the feature according to the task breakdown in `tasks.md`
3. Follow decisions recorded in `decisions.md`
4. Commit after completing each task — each commit is one logical unit of work
5. Update task statuses in `tasks.md` as you complete each one
6. Record any implementation notes or surprises in `notes.md`
7. Update `checklist.md` as items are completed

## Constraints

- Follow the project conventions in `CLAUDE.md`
- Only implement what is defined in the spec — do not add unrequested features
- If you encounter a decision not covered in `decisions.md`, stop and ask before proceeding
- If a task turns out to be more complex than expected, update `tasks.md` with subtasks
- Do not merge to master — the feature branch is merged after Acceptance

## Deliverables

- [ ] Feature branch created
- [ ] All Implementation tasks in `tasks.md` marked complete
- [ ] One commit per completed task on the feature branch
- [ ] Affected files list updated in `spec.md`
- [ ] Implementation notes captured in `notes.md`
- [ ] Any new decisions recorded in `decisions.md`
- [ ] Implementation items checked off in `checklist.md`
- [ ] Phase History updated in `spec.md`

## When Done

Summarize what was implemented and flag anything that needs attention during Testing.
