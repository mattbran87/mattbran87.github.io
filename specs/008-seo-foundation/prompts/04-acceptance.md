# Prompt: Acceptance

Read the feature spec at `specs/008-seo-foundation/spec.md` and all supporting documents in that directory.

## Objectives

1. Final review of the feature against all spec requirements
2. Confirm every acceptance criterion in `spec.md` is met
3. Review all decisions in `decisions.md` to ensure they were followed
4. Verify the tasks summary in `tasks.md` reflects the completed work
5. Update `checklist.md` as items are completed

## Constraints

- This is a review phase — only make changes to documentation files, not code
- If any acceptance criterion is NOT met, document what's missing and recommend returning to Implementation or Testing
- Be thorough — this is the final gate before marking the feature complete
